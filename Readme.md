# 🔐 Phishing Website Detection  

## 📌 Overview  
This project is a **Phishing Website Detection** system using the **Random Forest Classifier**. It predicts whether a given website is legitimate or phishing based on various extracted features.  

## 📊 Dataset Features  
The dataset includes several features that help distinguish phishing websites from legitimate ones:  

- 🌐 **Have_IP**  
- 📧 **Have_At**

- 📏 **URL_Depth**  
- 🔄 **Redirection**  
- 🔒 **https_Domain**  
- 🔽 **TinyURL**  
- ➕ **Prefix/Suffix**  
- 📡 **DNS_Record**  
- 📈 **Web_Traffic**  
- ⏳ **Domain_Age**  
- 📆 **Domain_End**  
- 🖼 **iFrame**  
- 🖱 **Mouse_Over**  
- 🛑 **Right_Click**  
- 🚀 **Web_Forwards**
